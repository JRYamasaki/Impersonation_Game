# Impersonation_Game

## Abstract
Our project is a web-based game (one-main feature). A new user may sign-up for the game with a new account that will keep track of their friends and points. Once logged in, the player will be taken to a host lobby which displays a list of all the game lobbies and the number of players present in them. The player may join a game lobby to play or they may join a random room. Once in a lobby, there are 2-4 players and one chatbot. A question is shown to everyone. The players and chatbot write a response and submit it. All responses are then shown on the screen. Everyone must then choose the one response that they think the chatbot created. They receive a point if they are correct. The player also receives a point if someone else choose their answer. The game continues for a certain number of rounds. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

During sessions, users will score points based on correct guesses. The Database will track correct guesses, incorrect guesses for each user, and how many other players you have fooled with your answer.

## Competitive Analysis
Other games that ask you to imitate AI behaviour: 

Garryâ€™s Mod: Guess Who - A game with hiders and seekers. The seekers try to find the hiders. The hiders try to blend in with other AI characters that do ridiculous actions like sit down, run, or walk into objects
 
Hidden in Plain Sight - A game where players are trying to complete certain objectives secretly amongst many AI players. Every player has a gun which has one bullet they can shoot at another character they think is an actual player.
